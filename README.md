# flow-free

This is my submission for Project 3 of COMP20003 Algorithms and Data Structures in Sem 2 2022. This program involves the implementation of a solver for the game Flow Free, a puzzle published by the professional puzzler Sam Loyd, in a column he wrote for the Brooklyn Daily Eagle in 1897. Some of code is built upon the open-source terminal version made available by mzucker.

## Overview

The game presents a grid with colored dots occupying some of the squares. The objective is to connect dots of the same color by drawing pipes between them such that the entire grid is occupied by pipes. However, pipes may not intersect. 

The difficulty is determined by the size of the grid, ranging from 5x5 to 15x15 squares.
